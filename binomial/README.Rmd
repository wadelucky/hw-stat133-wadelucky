## Overview

`"binomial"` is a minimal [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package 
that provides functions to calculate the probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

* `bin_choose()` calculates the number of combinations in which k successes can occur in n trials.
* `bin_probability()` calculates the probability of getting success successes or less successes in trials trials.
* `bin_distribution()` calculates the distribution of getting successes in trials given prob and has the object class `"bindis".` 
* `plot()` method graphs a barplot to display the probability histogram of a binomial distribution object `"bindis"`.
* `bin_cumulative()` computes the binomial cumulative distribution and has the object class `"bincum"`.
* `plot()` method graphs the cumulative distribution  of a binomial distribution object `"bincum"`.
* `bin_variable()` returns a `"binvar"` object which denotes the trials and prob.
* `print()` nicely print the content of an object `"binvar`.
* `summary()` method gets a full summary for a `"binvar"` object and returns a `"summary.binvar"` object.
* `print()` nicely print the contents of an object `"summary.binvar"`.


## Motivation

This package has been developed to illustrate some concepts of binomial distribution and show some statistics under it.


## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub via the package `"devtools"`:

```r
# development version from GitHub:
#install.packages("devtools") 

# install "binomial" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("wadelucky/hw-stat133-wadelucky
/binomial")

# install "binomial" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("wadelucky/hw-stat133-wadelucky/binomial", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
